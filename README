XorDecryptor.py
==============
XorDecryptor.py takes an encrypted file with xor and tries all the possible 1 byte-long hexa values as a key. Furthermore, on each output it verifies if the result is english text.
This is a quick modifcation of some already working python code.

Original Code
-------------
The detectEnglish library was taken from http://inventwithpython.com/detectEnglish.py
The xor code was taken from https://samsclass.info/124/proj14/p13-xor.htm

Put together by eldraco@gmail.com with some minor modifications

The dict2.txt file is an english dictionary. You can change this to detect any other language.
The xor.py code is not needed by the XorDecryptor. It is just for you to test it.

Example usage:
--------------

1- create a english text:
echo "This is an example english text" > example

2- Xor it with the letter 'm' as key
./xor.py example example.xor m

3- Now lets try to automatically detect which was the key, and if it was english.
./XorDecryptor.py example.xor
English detected with key: 109 (m): This is an example english text

There is an example already included that is called test.xor.
